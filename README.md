# SNN_Representation_of_Controlled_Ball_and_Plate
This repo represents the Controlled Dynamic Simplified Model of an Underactuated Ball and Plate System using a Spiking Neural Network-based representation using Nengo and the NEF.

The code is written to be executed both in the Nengo GUI and in any code editor.

Simulation represents the results presented in the paper presented at the 20th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE) Mexico City, Mexico. October 25-27, 2023 titled "Spiking Neural Network-based Control Applied to an Underactuated System"
